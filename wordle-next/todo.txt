Think how to provide to VM context different view models and pick them from useContext by vm identifier.
- Create hooks to take exact fields from $state.
- Create hook to take exact reducers from action.
- Resolve vm type narrowing on vm provided by viewModelContext.
- Check VM logic once again, maybe can simplify.
- Think about next steps how to provide user choices and hide enter button when choice is provided.
